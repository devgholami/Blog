These base weblog features have been implemented with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) since I felt the need to investigate react features and plugins. It takes advantage of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs) to make it more reliable and clear. I also used some famous react plugins in order to have a nice design and perfect possibilities. these plugins consist of:
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios#axios-api)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [React-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction)
- [Tinymce-react](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-react)
- [React-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.6.0)

Of course, all features that I want to implement are very furthermore. But I'm busy with the Angular version of this weblog. You can follow it [here]()
